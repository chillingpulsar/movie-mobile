# Movie App

A React Native movie app built with Expo, based on [JavaScript Mastery's free course](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f8Z9JyB2EIE).

## Key Differences

This version includes several improvements:

- **Supabase** backend instead of Appwrite
- **Performance optimizations** (FlatList virtualization, lazy loading)
- **Bun** runtime for faster package management

## Quick Start

1. Install dependencies

```bash
bun install
```

2. Start the development server

```bash
bunx expo start --clear
```

3. Open the app
    - Press `i` for iOS simulator
    - Press `a` for Android emulator
    - Scan QR code with Expo Go on your phone

## Tech Stack

- React Native + Expo
- TypeScript
- NativeWind (Tailwind CSS)
- Supabase
- Expo Router (file-based routing)
